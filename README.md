[**My thanks to Daniel Baumann! DebianDog wouldn't exist without his work.**](https://lists.debian.org/debian-live/2015/11/msg00024.html)

The DebianDog team also like to give thanks to Smokey and KazzaMozz for hosting DebianDog project
to Debian team for keeping Debian such flexible system,
to the murga-linux Puppy forum for the opportunity to work on a project different from puppy linux,
to our Puppy forum members working on DebianDog development:
Fred (fredx181), Terry (sunburnt), William (mcewanw), Sergey (sklimkin),
and for the valuable advices to: jbv, sfs, catsezmoo, big_bass, emil, dancytron, anikin from our forum
and dzz from www.debianuserforums.org
And to Sickgut for his original idea that made possible DebianDog to exist.

DebianDog is very small 32-bit Debian Live CD shaped to look and act like Puppy Linux. Debian structure and Debian behaviour are untouched and Debian documentation is 100% valid for DebianDog. You have access to all debian repositories using apt-get or synaptic.
