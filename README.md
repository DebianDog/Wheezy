# DebianDog Wheezy 

Versions available: jwm_icewm and openbox_xfce

DebianDog is very small Debian Wheezy Live CD shaped to look like Puppy and act like Puppy. Debian structure and Debian behaviour are untouched and Debian documentation is 100% valid for DebianDog. You have access to all debian repositories using apt-get or synaptic.

To test DebianDog for first time you need to burn it on CD and boot from it, or use DebianDog-installer (included in the iso and working from most linux systems) to make frugal install to HDD or USB, or to extract /live folder on top of a partition or USB and edit grub menu.lst.

DebianDog is set to autologin as root. If you like to use it as multiuser system it is recommended to start XDM login manager (available only in Jwm version). Just type in terminal xdm-start and reboot. xdm-stop will reverse back autologin as root.
